## Importing CGM data
By removing () from to_snake_case we can apply the effects of the function to other functions.
Currently this reads to_snake_case as an object.
read_csv() is a function. to_snake_case() is a function. to_snake_case is not a function, but an object. The properties of the object can then be integrated into other functions. 
```{r}
cgm_101 <- here("data-raw/dime/cgm/101.csv") |>
  read_csv(
    show_col_types = FALSE,
    name_repair = to_snake_case,
    n_max = 100
  )

sleep_101 <- here("data-raw/dime/sleep/101.csv") |>
  read_csv(
    show_col_types = FALSE,
    name_repair = to_snake_case,
    n_max = 100
  )
sleep_101
```
